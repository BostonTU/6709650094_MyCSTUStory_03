            <h1>My Journey - Year 1</h1>
            <p>Starting my journey in CSTU in my first year was a big change from school to university. I encountered many new things, such as new friends, teachers, and more intensive course content.</p>
            
            <h2>Adjusting in the first year</h2>
            <p>At the beginning, I had to adjust from a structured high school education to a university education that required more self-responsibility. I not only had to understand the content in the classroom, but also had to research and learn from other sources on my own.</p>
            
            <h2>Subjects Learned</h2>
            <p>In my first year, I learned basic computer science subjects such as Programming Fundamentals and Data Structures, which gave me a foundation for coding and analyzing software problems.</p>
            
            <h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>
            <p>The challenges I encountered in my first year were learning new content and having to rely more on myself when researching and doing homework. I used to feel discouraged when I failed to code or solve a problem, but I learned not to give up. And turn to friends and teachers for help.</p>
            
            <h2>What I plan to do next</h2>
            <p>In the coming years, I hope to further develop my programming skills and learn new technologies related to software development. I aim to join internships and research projects in order to gain real-world experience and apply the knowledge I gain to my future work.</p>
